# Git
<p>Officially <strong>Git</strong> is a <strong>version control system.</strong></p>
It's like a really  <strong>epic save button</strong> for <em>files</em> and <em>directories.</em> A save in <strong>Git</strong> records <strong>differences</strong> in the <strong>files</strong> and <strong>folders</strong> AND keeps a <strong>historical record of each save.</strong></p>
<strong>Git</strong> <em>enables</em> to review <strong>how a project grows</strong> and to easily <strong>look at or restore file states from the past.</strong> Once connected to a <em>network</em>, <strong>Git</strong> allows you to <strong>push a project to GitHub</strong>.</p>

- <strong>Git</strong> works on <strong>your local machine</strong> 
- <strong>GitHub</strong> is a <strong>remote storage facility on the web</strong> for all your <strong><em>coding projects</em></strong> 

This means that by learning <strong>Git</strong>, you will get to <em>showcase your</em> <strong>portfolio</strong> on <strong>GitHub!</strong>
