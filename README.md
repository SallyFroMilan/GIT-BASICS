# Git
<p>Officially <strong>Git</strong> is a <em>version control system.</em></p>
It's like an <strong>epic save button</strong> for <em>files</em> and <em>directories.</em><br> 
A save in <strong>Git</strong> records <strong>differences</strong> in <em>files</em> and <em>folders</em> AND keeps an <strong>historical record</strong> of <em>each save.</em></p>
<strong>Git</strong> enables to review <strong>how a project grows</strong> and to easily <strong>look at or restore file states from the past.</strong><br>
Once connected to a <em>network</em>, <strong>Git</strong> allows you to <strong>push a project to GitHub</strong>.</p>

- <strong>Git</strong> works on <strong>your local machine</strong> 
- <strong>GitHub</strong> is a <strong>remote storage facility on the web</strong> for all your <strong><em>coding projects</em></strong> 

This means that by learning <strong>Git</strong>, you will get to <em>showcase your</em> <strong>portfolio</strong> on <strong>GitHub!</strong>
